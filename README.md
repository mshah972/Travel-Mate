# TravelMate ‚Äì AI-Powered Group Trip Planner
TravelMate is a collaborative web application designed to simplify the process of planning group trips. It empowers users to co-create the perfect vacation by leveraging AI to generate personalized itinerary suggestions based on everyone's input. Groups can then vote on their favorite plan, ensuring a democratic and enjoyable planning experience for all.

Live Demo: (coming soon)

## ‚ú® Key Features
- Collaborative Trip Creation: Easily create a new trip and invite friends to join via a unique link.

- Democratic Voting System: All trip members can view the AI-generated itineraries and vote for their favorite one in real-time.

- Interactive Map View: Visualize your destination and potential points of interest using an integrated Mapbox map.

- Real-Time Updates: Built on Google Firestore, all trip details, messages, and votes are updated in real-time for a seamless collaborative experience.
